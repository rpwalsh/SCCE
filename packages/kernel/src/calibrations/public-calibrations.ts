/**
 * The public bootstrap values for constants that were hand-set inline.
 *
 * Every value here was moved verbatim from the call site named in its comment, so installing this table changes
 * no behaviour. What changes is that each value now has an id, which is what the private side needs in order to
 * override one: a fitted value cannot replace a literal buried in an expression.
 *
 * These are BOOTSTRAP values, not measured ones. `calibration_observations` currently carries two ids
 * (candidate.mass, judge.requirement_weights), so none of the values below has ever been fitted -- they are
 * defaults that happened to work, and several have been measured deciding answers on their own:
 * units.prefix_ratio_floor decided whether "Kenya's" names Kenya (5/7 = 0.714 against 0.72), and
 * ranking.title_lead_boost outranked a BM25 gap of 8.2 against 4.8.
 *
 * Ids follow calibration-spine.ts's convention: subsystem, then what the value governs.
